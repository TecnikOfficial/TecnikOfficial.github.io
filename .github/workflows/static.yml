To tweak the GitHub Actions workflow for caching to improve performance, you can utilize caching actions to cache dependencies or build artifacts. Here's an updated version of your workflow that includes caching to improve performance:

```yaml
# Simple workflow for deploying static content to GitHub Pages with caching
name: Deploy static content to Pages with caching

on:
  # Runs on pushes targeting the default branch
  push:
    branches: ["main"]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# Sets permissions of the GITHUB_TOKEN to allow deployment to GitHub Pages
permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

# Allow only one concurrent deployment, skipping runs queued between the run in-progress and latest queued.
# However, do NOT cancel in-progress runs as we want to allow these production deployments to complete.
concurrency:
  group: "pages"
  cancel-in-progress: false

jobs:
  # Single deploy job since we're just deploying
  deploy:
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Pages
        uses: actions/configure-pages@v5

      - name: Cache dependencies
        uses: actions/cache@v2
        with:
          path: ~/.npm
          key: npm-${{ runner.os }}-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
          restore-keys: |
            npm-${{ runner.os }}-

      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
        with:
          # Upload entire repository
          path: '.'

      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
```

In this updated workflow:
- A caching step is added before deploying to cache npm dependencies to improve build performance. Adjust the path and keys based on your specific dependencies.
- The caching action helps speed up the workflow by storing dependencies between workflow runs.
- The rest of the workflow remains the same, deploying the static content to GitHub Pages.

By incorporating caching in your workflow, you can optimize the build process and reduce the time it takes to deploy your static content to GitHub Pages. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!
